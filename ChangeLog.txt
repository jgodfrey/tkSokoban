CHANGES FROM 0.70 TO 0.71

 - Added undo check points, both manual and automatic. By selecting a
   menu item, hitting Ctrl+C or button-2, a check point is put into 
   global(undoList). Selecting a menu item, hitting Ctrl+B or
   Ctrl-Button 3, the board is reverted back to the last checkpoint
   state.

   Automatic checkpointing is a checkButton in a menu. If on, then
   after every 10 moves, a check point is added to the undo stack.
   Note, this required reversing the direction the stack grew in, i.e.
   you insert and remove from the front.

 - I wanted to know which levels I had completed when I was in the
   Select Level dialog, so I started the rudiments of an rc file.

   When you complete a level, it stores the current time, your time, 
   moves and pushes into global(times,<levelName>). This gets written
   out to an lib/tkSokoban.rc in the background while the statistics
   dialog is up. This file is loaded at startup. In the Select Level
   dialog, the date is appended to all completed levels.

   An obvious next step with this feature is to have you start at the
   first non-completed level. Also, goto next and previous
   non-completed level would be nice.

   There's really three things here: 1) rc file support, 2) level
   solved or unsolved, 3) best score per level data. All three could
   be extended but I just wanted to get 2) working.

 - Fixed bug in loadSkin where it was doing an extra file join.

 - Cleaned up menu code so that the accelerator info is specified not
   in the "-label" but in "-accelerator" so that things line up nicer.

 - Changed "Undo last move" accelerator from Backspace to Ctrl-Z to match
   standard Windows undo functionality.
